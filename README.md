# docker-environments
Buckle up ladies, gents and nb friends. Here is the product of my flailing about trying to put out my (python) environment dumpster fires. 

### The idea:
- One docker file to layer them all
- Then a bunch of other niche dockerfiles depending on the use case context / project requirements. 

### To build: 
```docker-compose build ```

Will probably throw into a makefile at some point hopefully. 

Here goes !
